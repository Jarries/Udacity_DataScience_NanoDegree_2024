Comments are used effectively and each function has a docstring. Go into more detail about the dataset and your data cleaning and modeling process in your README file, add screenshots of your web app and model results.
This dataset is imbalanced (ie some labels like water have few examples). In your README, discuss how this imbalance, how that affects training the model, and your thoughts about emphasizing precision or recall for the various categories.


## Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out
- Go into more detail about the dataset and your data cleaning and modeling process in your README file, add screenshots of your web app and model results.
- Add more visualizations to the web app.
- Based on the categories that the ML algorithm classifies text into, advise some organizations to connect to.
- Customize the design of the web app.
- Deploy the web app to a cloud service provider.
- Improve the efficiency of the code in the ETL and ML pipeline.
